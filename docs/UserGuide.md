## About TeachMeSenpai

TeachMeSenpai is a **desktop app targeted at teaching assistants who have many students to keep track of.** It is tailored to assist the user in monitoring their students' progress, and details. 
As a teaching assistant, you can easily view and edit your student's details on the go. Tailored to fast-typist, TeachMeSenpai is built around a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**, complete with an **autocomplete** feature
to help you manage your students quicker than a traditional point-and-click interface can.

This user guide provides everything you need to know to get started with TeachMeSenpai and how to use its features.
Head over to the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section to get started with setting up, or the [Features](#features) section
to learn more about what TeachMeSenpai can do!

## Features

> <ins>:bulb: **Notes about the command format:**</ins>
> 
> - Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.  
>   _(eg. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`)_
>
> - Items in square brackets are optional.  
>   _(eg. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`)_
> 
> - Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.  
>   _(eg. `[t/TAG]...` can be excluded completely, or once `t/friend`, or twice `t/friend t/family`, etc.)_
> 
> - Parameters can be in any order.  
>   _(eg. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable)_
> 
> - If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.  
>   _(eg. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken)_
> 
> - Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.  
>   _(eg. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`)_

### Find/filter students: `find`

Finds entries of students based on a keyword in the field that you want. <br>

The `find` command allows you to match keywords or partial keywords with the entries, for example:<br><br>
`find Sh` displays the students with names which contain `sh` in them, such as `Shaun` or `Amresh`.<br>
This applies to all fields EXCEPT tags and subjects, where you will have to enter and find them by the 
tags and subjects in full.

> Format: `find FIELD KEYWORDS...` <br>
* `FIELD` refers to the type of details such as name, address, email and so on.
* Input the field like so:
  * Name: `n/`
  * Address: `a/`
  * Email: `e/`
  * Phone No.: `p/`
  * Education: `edu/`
  * Remark: `r/`
  * Tags: `t/`
  * Subjects: `s/`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

>:bulb: **Note:** No input in the `FIELD` defaults to finding by name.

</div>

Examples:

- `find Sh` will display the students named "Shao Hong" & "Shaun"
- `find a/ pas` will display students who stay at places which names that contain `pas` such as `Pasir Ris`
- `find t/ URGENT` will display students who have the exact tag `URGENT`
- `find s/ German` will display students who have the exact subject `German`

<p align=center>
    <img alt="find before" src="images/user-guide/find_before.jpg" />
    <br><i><b>Above:</b> Before entering <code>find</code> command</i>
</p>

<p align=center>
    <img alt="find after" src="images/user-guide/find_after.jpg" />
    <br><i><b>Above:</b> After entering <code>find</code> command</i>
</p>

### Delete a student: `delete`

Deletes the specified student from the address book.

> Format: `delete INDEX`

- Deletes the student at the specified `INDEX`.
- The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed student list.
- The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ...

Examples:

- `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd student in the address book.

<p align=center>
    <img alt="delete before" src="images/user-guide/delete_before.jpg" />
    <br><i><b>Above:</b> Before entering <code>delete</code> command</i>
</p>

<p align=center>
    <img alt="delete after" src="images/user-guide/delete_after.jpg" />
    <br><i><b>Above:</b> After entering <code>delete</code> command</i>
</p>

> :slightly_smiling_face: **Tip:** You can combine `find` and `delete` when you have a 
> very long list of students. <br>
> For instance, you can `find` the student(s) you want gone, and then `delete`
> using the index from the list displayed!
