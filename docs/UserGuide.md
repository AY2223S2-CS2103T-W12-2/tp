## Quick start

TODO: Installation guide

## Features

> üí° Notes about the command format
> 
> - Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.  
>   e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
> - Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.  
>   e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as  <code> </code> (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
> - Items in square brackets are optional.  
>   e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
> - Parameters can be in any order.  
>   e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
> - If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.  
>   e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
> - Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.  
>   e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
