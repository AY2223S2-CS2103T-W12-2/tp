### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

## Add Feature

### Implementation Details

The implementation of the `add` command involves creating a new `Student` object and storing it in `AddressBook`.

Given below is a class diagram on the `Student` class and the classes related to its attributes: <br>

![student_diagram](images/StudentClassDiagram.png)

The `Student` object is composed of attributes:

* `Name`: The name of the student.
* `Phone`: The phone number of the student.
* `Email`: The email address of the student.
* `Address`: The address of the student.
* `Education`: The education level of the student.
* `Subject`: The subjects the tutor is teaching the student.
* `Remark`: Remarks/notes the tutor has about the student.

### Proposed Implementation
The `add` command has the following fields:
> NOTE : `[COMPULSORY]` indicates that the field is cannot be omitted when using `add`. 
> Unless stated as`[COMPULSORY]`, the field is optional.
* Prefix `\n` followed by the name of the student `[COMPULSORY]`.
* Prefix `\p` followed by the phone number of the student.
* Prefix `\e` followed by the student's email.
* Prefix `\a` followed by the student's address.
* Prefix `\edu` followed by the student's education level.
* Prefix `\s` followed by the subject name.
* Prefix `\r` followed by the remarks/notes on the student.

Here is a sequence diagram showing the interactions between components when `add n/Alice edu/Primary 6` is run.: <br>

![add_sequence](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

### Feature details
1. The app will validate the parameters supplied by the user with pre-determined formats for each attribute.
2. If an input fails the validation check, an error message is provided which details the error and prompts the user for a corrected input.
3. If the input passes the validation check, a new `Student` entry is created and stored in the `AddressBook`.

### General Design Considerations

The implementation of the attributes of a `Student` is very similar to that of a `Person` in the original AB3 codebase. 
Hence, resulting in a similar implementation of the `add` feature. </br>

Some additions made were the `Education`, `Subject` and `Remark` attributes. </br>
1. `Education` is implemented similar to the other attributes like `Address`, but is modified to fit the logic that a student can only have one education level.
2. `Subject` is implemented in a similar way to `Tags` in AB3 but has been modified to accomodate subject names that are more than one word long as in real life.
3. Every attribute except`Name` has been made **OPTIONAL** to accomodate circumstances where some student's details are unknown at the time of entry.
    * We utilised the [java.util.Optional<T>](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Optional.html "java.util.Optional<T>") class to encapsulate the optional logic of the attributes.

When adding a student entry, these were the alternatives considered.
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only `Name` has to be specified to create a `Student` entry, making the other attributes `Optional<>`.
    * Pros:
        * Improves user convenience by allowing them to add a `Student` entry even with limited knowledge about their details.
    * Cons:
        * A lot of modification for empty/*null* inputs have to be accounted for when saving the data and testing.
* **Alternative 2:** All parameters have to be filled in
    * Pros:
        * Easier to implement as there is lesser room for errors when dealing with empty/*null* inputs
    * Cons:
        * `add` becomes a lengthy command to execute as unnecessary additional time is needed to enter dummy values to meet the input requirements.
        * Reduces user convenience as "useful" entries that can be made are limited to students whose details are all known.
## Edit Feature

### Implementation Details

The implementation of `edit` involves creating a new `Student` object with updated details to replace the previous `Student` object.
This is done with the help of the `EditPersonDescriptor` class, which helps create the new `Student` object.

With a similar fields to the [Add feature](#add-feature), `edit` has an additional `INDEX` parameter. </br>
> NOTE : `[COMPULSORY]` indicates that the field is cannot be omitted when using `add`. 
> Unless stated as`[COMPULSORY]`, the field is optional.
* `INDEX` which represents the index number of the student to be edited in the list.
* Prefix `\n` followed by the name of the student.
* Prefix `\p` followed by the phone number of the student.
* Prefix `\e` followed by the student's email.
* Prefix `\a` followed by the student's address.
* Prefix `\edu` followed by the student's education level.
* Prefix `\s` followed by the subject name.
* Prefix `\r` followed by the remarks/notes on the student.

Here is a sequence diagram showing the interactions between components when `edit 1 n/Bob edu/Primary 5` is run.: <br>

![edit_sequence](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

### Feature details
1. Similar to `add`, the app will validate the parameters supplied by the user with pre-determined formats for each attribute.
2. If an input fails the validation check, an error message is provided which details the error and prompts the user for a corrected input.
3. If the input passes the validation check, the corresponding `Student` is replaced by a new edited `Student` object and stored in the `AddressBook`.

### General Design Considerations
When editing a student entry, whether a new `Student` object should be created.
* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** `edit` will create a new `Student` object with the help of `EditPersonDescriptor`
  * Pros:
    * Meets the expectations of the immutable `Student` class.
  * Cons:
    * Inefficient as an entire `Student` object is created even if only one field is changed. </br>
    
* **Alternative 2:** `edit` directly sets the updated values in the existing `Student` object directly.
  * Pros:
    * More timely option and space efficient.
  * Cons:
    * In order to execute this, `Student` cannot be immutable, this reduces the defensiveness of the program, making it more susceptible to errors.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
