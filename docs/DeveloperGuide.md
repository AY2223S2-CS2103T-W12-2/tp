### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

## Add Feature

### Implementation Details

The implementation of the `add` command involves creating a new `Student` object and storing it in `AddressBook`. <br>

Given below is a class diagram on the `Student` class and the classes related to its attributes: <br>

![student_diagram](images/StudentClassDiagram.png) 

The `Student` object is composed of attributes:

* `Name`: The name of the student.
* `Phone`: The phone number of the student.
* `Email`: The email address of the student.
* `Address`: The address of the student.
* `Education`: The education level of the student.
* `Subject`: The subjects the tutor is teaching the student.
* `Remark`: Remarks/notes the tutor has about the student.

### Proposed Implementation
The `add` command has the following fields:
> NOTE : `[COMPULSORY]` indicates that the field is cannot be omitted when using `add`. 
> Unless stated as`[COMPULSORY]`, the field is optional.
* Prefix `\n` followed by the name of the student `[COMPULSORY]`.
* Prefix `\p` followed by the phone number of the student.
* Prefix `\e` followed by the student's email.
* Prefix `\a` followed by the student's address.
* Prefix `\edu` followed by the student's education level.
* Prefix `\s` followed by the subject name.
* Prefix `\r` followed by the remarks/notes on the student.

Here is a sequence diagram showing the interactions between components when `add n/Alice edu/Primary 6` is run.: <br>

![add_sequence](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

### Feature details
1. The app will validate the parameters supplied by the user with pre-determined formats for each attribute.
2. If an input fails the validation check, an error message is provided which details the error and prompts the user for a corrected input.
3. If the input passes the validation check, a new `Student` entry is created and stored in the `AddressBook`.

### General Design Considerations

The implementation of the attributes of a `Student` is very similar to that of a `Person` in the original AB3 codebase. 
Hence, resulting in a similar implementation of the `add` feature. </br>

Some additions made were the `Education`, `Subject` and `Remark` attributes. </br>
1. `Education` is implemented similar to the other attributes like `Address`, but is modified to fit the logic that a student can only have one education level.
2. `Subject` is implemented in a similar way to `Tags` in AB3 but has been modified to accomodate subject names that are more than one word long as in real life.
3. Every attribute except`Name` has been made **OPTIONAL** to accomodate circumstances where some student's details are unknown at the time of entry.
    * We utilised the [java.util.Optional<T>](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Optional.html "java.util.Optional<T>") class to encapsulate the optional logic of the attributes.

When adding a student entry, these were the alternatives considered.
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only `Name` has to be specified to create a `Student` entry, making the other attributes `Optional<>`.
    * Pros:
        * Improves user convenience by allowing them to add a `Student` entry even with limited knowledge about their details.
    * Cons:
        * A lot of modification for empty/*null* inputs have to be accounted for when saving the data and testing.
* **Alternative 2:** All parameters have to be filled in
    * Pros:
        * Easier to implement as there is lesser room for errors when dealing with empty/*null* inputs
    * Cons:
        * `add` becomes a lengthy command to execute as unnecessary additional time is needed to enter dummy values to meet the input requirements.
        * Reduces user convenience as "useful" entries that can be made are limited to students whose details are all known.

## Delete feature

### Implementation Details

The `delete` implementation is identical to the implementation in AB3's codebase.

### Proposed Implementation
The proposed `delete` implementation supports deleting multiple `Student` entries at once. For example `delete 1 3 5` will delete the `Student` entries at indexes 1, 3 and 5 in the  `AddressBook` 
> Assuming the indexes are valid.

// TODO sequence diagram

### Design Considerations
// TODO

## Edit Feature

### Implementation Details

The implementation of `edit` involves creating a new `Student` object with updated details to replace the previous `Student` object.
This is done with the help of the `EditPersonDescriptor` class, which helps create the new `Student` object.

With a similar fields to the [Add feature](#add-feature), `edit` has an additional `INDEX` parameter. </br>
> NOTE : `[COMPULSORY]` indicates that the field is cannot be omitted when using `add`.
> Unless stated as`[COMPULSORY]`, the field is optional.
* `INDEX` which represents the index number of the student to be edited in the list.
* Prefix `\n` followed by the name of the student.
* Prefix `\p` followed by the phone number of the student.
* Prefix `\e` followed by the student's email.
* Prefix `\a` followed by the student's address.
* Prefix `\edu` followed by the student's education level.
* Prefix `\s` followed by the subject name.
* \[To be implemented\] Prefix `\r` followed by the remarks/notes on the student.

Here is a sequence diagram showing the interactions between components when `edit 1 n/Bob edu/Primary 5` is run.: <br>

![edit_sequence](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

### Feature details
1. Similar to `add`, the app will validate the parameters supplied by the user with pre-determined formats for each attribute.
2. If an input fails the validation check, an error message is provided which details the error and prompts the user for a corrected input.
3. If the input passes the validation check, the corresponding `Student` is replaced by a new edited `Student` object and stored in the `AddressBook`.

### General Design Considerations
When editing a student entry, whether a new `Student` object should be created.
* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** `edit` will create a new `Student` object with the help of `EditPersonDescriptor`
    * Pros:
        * Meets the expectations of the immutable `Student` class.
    * Cons:
        * Inefficient as an entire `Student` object is created even if only one field is changed. </br>

* **Alternative 2:** `edit` directly sets the updated values in the existing `Student` object directly.
    * Pros:
        * More timely option and space efficient.
    * Cons:
        * In order to execute this, `Student` cannot be immutable, this reduces the defensiveness of the program, making it more susceptible to errors.


## Find feature

### Implementation Details

The proposed `find` feature is implemented using `MultiFieldContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`. <br>

Both of which implement the `Predicate<Person>` interface where the `test` method checks whether the data in the relevant field of a `Student` contains the specified keyword.

Here is a sequence diagram showing the interactions between components when `find Alice` is run.: <br>
// TODO sequence diagram

### Feature details
Our implementation extends from the `find` implementation in AB3 by accommodating `find PARTIAL_KEYWORD` on top of the current `find KEYWORD`.
> An example of `PARTIAL_KEYWORD` is "Ye" while `KEYWORD` would be "Yeoh". <br>

### General Design Considerations
THe implementation of `find` is built on top of the original AB3 codebase's `find` command. <br>

Our implementation has some additions such as:
1. Allowing `PARTIAL_KEYWORD` finds so that we can accommodate for the real-life scenarios where users are not certain of the full `KEYWORD` to input for `find`.
2. `find PREFIX` across the various attributes of a `Student` other than their `Name`

**Aspect: Command format:**
* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** `find PREFIX KEYWORD/PARTIAL_KEYWORD`
  * Pros:
    * Improves user convenience by giving them flexibility in the completeness of their desired find keyword.
    * Extensible across other attributes.
  * Cons:
    * Adds complexity to the implementation as this implementation introduces a lot of potential errors in parsing the user's input.
    * Might be slightly challenging for new users to enter the `PREFIX`.
* **Alternative 2:** `find KEYWORD/PARTIAL_KEYWORD`
  * Pros:
    * Easier to implement as there is lesser validating done by the app.
    * Provides the user flexibility in searching across all attributes by default.
  * Cons:
    * The filtered list may not be what was desired as short partial keywords like `a` is unlikely to result in a succinct list.
    * Users will not be able to search keywords for a particular attribute.

## List feature

### Implementation Details
The `list` implementation is identical to the implementation in AB3's codebase.
// TODO sequence diagram
### Design Consideration
// TODO
### \[Proposed\] Sort feature

### Proposed Implementation

The proposed `sort` implementation will sort the `UniquePersonList` object, hence it will make use of: <br>
* `sort` in [javafx.collections.FXCollections](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/api/javafx/collections/FXCollections.html) for the main sorting functionality.
  * In order to sort by `Name`, the comparator will be as follows `Comparator<Name>`.
* `comparing` in [java.util.Comparator](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html) class to execute `sort` in ascending and descending orders. <br>

An example usage would be `sort ASC` to sort the list in ascending order, and `sort DESC` to sort the list in descending order.
> `ASC` and `DESC` will not be case-sensitive, in other words, `sort ASC` and `sort asc` are both acceptable commands.

#### Exepected execution:
1. Upon entering the command `sort ASC` in the command line of the application, the list of students will be sorted in alphabetically ascending order of their `Name`.
2. Upon entering the command `sort DESC` in the command line of the application , the list of students will be sorted in alphabetically descending order of their `Name`.

### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: Command format:**
* **Alternative 1:** `sort`
  * Pros:
    * Simpler command for users to execute
  * Cons:
      * Less flexible as users cannot decide which attribute to sort by.
      * Reduces extensibility of the feature (eg. sort by subject tag is more complicated if `sort` doesn't accept inputs)
      * Users cannot choose which order to sort in as it will be defaulted to sorting in ascending order.
* **Alternative 2 (Current choice):** `sort ORDER`
  * Pros:
    * Provides extensibility of sort (eg. future implementation of `sort edu ORDER` to sort by education level)
    * Allows users to choose the order they would like to sort the list by
    * Gives flexibility and convenience to users.
  * Cons:
    * Adds complexity to the implementation as more error checking of the inputs is required.
  
_{more aspects to be added}_

## Remark feature

#### Feature Implementation Details
The current implementation provides users with two different methods of entering a remark for a student.
1. `remark INDEX r/REMARK` where `INDEX` is the `Student` entry in the list, and `REMARK` is the remark to be added.
2. Adding the remark through the [add feature](#Add-feature)

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed remark mechanism will be facilitated by a pop-up text box. This will allows users to format their remarks however they like, 
rather than being restricted to a single line in the command line (current implementation).

### General Design Considerations
In order to make this feature as versatile as possible, the `remark` feature should consider formatted inputs (eg. new lines to separate paragraphs). <br>
Additionally, the command line only provides a restricted view and input option for users, hence it does not support formatted remarks.

**Aspect: Command input format**
* **Alternative 1: (Current implementation)** Adding the `remark` through the command line.
  * Pros:
    * Easier to implement
  * Cons:
    * Restricts users to a single line or continuous paragraph of remark.
    * Limits formatting options for remark.
* **Alternative 2: (Future implementation)** Adding remark through a pop-up text window
  * Pros:
    * Provides users flexibility in the format of their remarks.
    * Remarks are not restricted to a single line or continuous paragraph.
  * Cons:
    * More complicated to implement as the format of the remarks have to be saved and loaded into `AddressBook` without any formatting erros.

**Aspect: Remark display**
* **Alternative 1: (Current choice)** Preview the first line of a student's remarks under all the other attributes
  * Pros:
    * Short remarks are instantly visible to users.
    * Easy to implement.
  * Cons:
    * Remarks are limited to a single line as long as the width of the window.
    * Formatting of remarks are not visible.
* **Alternative 2: (Future implementation)** If a remark is present, simply display an indicator in `PersonCard`
  * Pros:
    * Easy to implement.
    * Viewing the remark in `ResultDisplay` is supported by the [show](#show-feature) command.
    * Supports formatting of `remark` since it is not restricted to the `PersonCard` view.
  * Cons:
    * An extra step for users may be inconvenient
* **Alternative 3:** Show the full remark in `PersonCard` beside all the other attributes
  * Pros:
    * Remark is directly visible from the list.
    * Supports formatting in `remark`.
  * Cons:
    * Remarks are limited to the view of `PersonCard` and size of the window.
    * Remarks that are too long will be cut off and not visible.

### Show feature

### Implementation Details
The implementation of `show` is similar to the `list` command in the AB3 codebase. The `show` feature was implemented to support the `remark` feature. <br>
Remarks longer than the width of `PersonListCard` in `PersonListPanel` 
will not be visible. Hence, `show` allows users to view the full remark in the `ResultDisplay` since scrolling is supported.

### General Design Considerations
**Aspect: Display output**
* **Alternative 1: (Future implementation)** Display the entire `PersonCard` of the student chosen in `PersonListPanel`.
  * Pros:
    * Allows users to view the student details and remarks all at once.
    * Supports the `remark` feature as intended
  * Cons:
    * May reduce user convenience as `show INDEX` will likely always be followed with the `list` command to toggle back to the full list of students.
    * Harder to implement as the size of the `PersonCard` for the `Student` has to be updated everytime `show` is executed.
  
* **Alternative 2: (Current choice)** Display the entire `PersonCard` of the student chosen in the `ResultDisplay`
  * Pros:
    * Supports the `remark` feature as intended since scrolling is possible.
    * Allows users to view the student details and remarks all at once.
  * Cons:
    * Harder to implement
  
### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
