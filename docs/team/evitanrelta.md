### Project: TeachMeSenpai

TeachMeSenpai **is a student managing application** specially customised for **teaching assistants** who have a lot of
students to keep track of. It is tailored to assist the user in monitoring their students' progress, and details. TeachMeSenpai is optimised for fast-typists with a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** so users can easily edit their student's details, with the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** so users can conveniently view their student entries.
